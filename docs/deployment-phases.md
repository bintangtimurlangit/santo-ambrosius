# Production Deployment Phases

## Overview
This document outlines the phases required to deploy the Santo Ambrosius project to production on a Hostinger VPS with automatic deployment via GitHub Actions and comprehensive monitoring.

## Phase 1: VPS Preparation & Security
- SSH Key Setup for GitHub Actions
- VPS Security Hardening
- System Package Updates
- Firewall Configuration (UFW)
- Fail2ban Setup
- Non-root User Creation
- Prerequisites Installation (Docker, Nginx, Certbot, Git)

## Phase 2: Production Docker Configuration
- Update docker-compose.yml for Production
- Remove Development-specific Configurations
- Add Production Environment Variables
- Configure Proper Networking
- Set up Health Checks
- Environment Configuration
- Database Settings Configuration
- Logging Configuration

## Phase 3: Nginx Reverse Proxy Setup
- Nginx Site Configuration
- SSL Certificate Setup with Let's Encrypt
- Reverse Proxy Configuration to Docker Containers
- Security Headers Configuration
- SSL Certificate Auto-renewal Setup

## Phase 4: GitHub Actions CI/CD
- GitHub Workflow Creation
- Deployment Action Configuration
- Secrets and Environment Variables Setup
- Build and Test Steps Configuration
- Deployment Script Creation on VPS
- Docker Container Update Handling
- Database Migration Handling (if needed)

## Phase 5: Monitoring & Logging
- Container Monitoring Setup
- Prometheus + Grafana Configuration
- Container Health, CPU, and Memory Monitoring
- Alert Configuration
- Application Monitoring Setup
- Application Logs Configuration
- Log Rotation Setup
- Application Performance Monitoring
- Uptime Monitoring Setup
- External Uptime Monitoring
- Alerting Configuration

## Monitoring Stack Options

### Option A: Lightweight (Recommended for Start)
- Prometheus (Metrics Collection)
- Grafana (Visualization and Dashboards)
- Node Exporter (System Metrics)
- cAdvisor (Container Metrics)

### Option B: Full Stack
- Prometheus + Grafana (Metrics and Visualization)
- ELK Stack (Log Aggregation: Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- AlertManager (Alerting)
- Uptime Kuma (External Uptime Monitoring)

## Architecture Overview
```
Internet → Cloudflare → VPS (Nginx) → Docker Containers
```

## Recommended Implementation Order
1. Phase 1: VPS setup and security
2. Phase 2.5: GitHub Actions CI/CD setup
3. Phase 2: Production Docker configuration
4. Phase 3: Nginx reverse proxy setup
5. Manual Testing: Deploy once manually to ensure everything works
6. Phase 4: Production deployment via GitHub Actions
7. Phase 5: Monitoring and logging

## Prerequisites
- Hostinger VPS with root access
- Domain name configured with Cloudflare
- GitHub repository with admin access
- Basic understanding of Docker, Nginx, and Linux administration
